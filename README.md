My semester project, in which I created my own 2D game engine and a game on it called ZERO POINT

Plot:
The game will feature a universe where the Zero Point research center exists, focused on the development of chemical weapons and modern technologies in physics, chemistry, and weapon development. During an unsuccessful experiment in one of the research rooms, there was an explosion and a leak of a secret virus. Most of the complex's employees perished and, under the influence of the virus, which affects the dead brain, turned into zombies who will be the main enemies of the player.

Game Objective:
The goal of the game is to escape from the destroyed complex by following the emergency protocol, which states that all employees in case of emergency must go to complex X for further instructions. The player will have to progress upwards through the floors. Each floor represents a level. The game will feature 2 levels. Passing a level means opening the doors leading to the next floor, marked as "EXIT."

The player will encounter surviving scientists who will gradually tell them what happened and help them overcome obstacles, such as advising where to find a key or where a weapon lies. They will also give some items that will help the player escape, such as a key, a first aid kit, or a weapon, or these items can be found on the map. It will be possible to create additional items from the collected items. The player will have an inventory and crafting option. Crafting recipes can either be found in documents in the lab or learned from the complex's employees.

Items in the Game:
Weapon: pistol, superWeapon
Door key, levelKey
Crafting material
Ammo for the pistol
First aid kit, which adds 20 health points to the player
Threats:
The main threat to the player will be enemies (zombies). These enemies are infected complex employees (zombies) who will attack the player and reduce health upon hitting (20 points).

Saving and Loading the Game:
The player will be able to save and load the game from the last save point. The following will be saved:

Player's position on the map
Player's health status
Inventory status
Opened doors
Levels:
The game will feature 2 levels. Progressing to the next level means finding the key to the final door of the level. Levels will be loaded from a file describing the positions of NPCs and the player, item locations, items, and doors.

Crafting:
During the game, the player will collect items and will need special items for crafting. For example, pistol + material = super pistol. The recipe will be given to the player by an NPC.

Controls:
A – move left
D – move right
W – move forward
S – move backward
SHIFT – speed up (+2 to speed)
F – open inventory
E – action (e.g., open door)
H – heal
R – reload pistol
Space – shoot (attack)
The player will have a health indicator (100 units).
